Lazy Loading - No SEO Negative Impact

Qazy is a image lazy loader and is library agnostic (no jQuery).

Qazy removes the <a href=".qnimate.com/qazy-lazy-loading/">negative SEO impact</a> that is caused by other lazy loaders.

Load the script as soon as possible in the webpage so that it can start tracking the images and load them lazily.
